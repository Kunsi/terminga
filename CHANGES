Release history for terminga

next
  [Fixed]
  - Backspace key now works in terminals other than XTerm, too.
  - Overly long check outputs can no longer use up the whole window
    space.

  [Changed]
  - Config ~/.terminga is now a JSON file.

  [Added]
  - Filter strings can now be passed to Icinga / terminga-proxy. Allows
    you to work on only those systems that match certain criteria.
  - A simple scroll indicator.

v5  2019-11-26
  [Added]
  - "v" pops the left-most filter.

v4  2019-10-30
  [Fixed]
  - We now only set 20 downtimes/re-checks in one API request. Icinga
    crashes with a segfault when we try to set 100.

v3  2019-09-30
  [Fixed]
  - Entering invalid regular expressions as filters no longer crashes
    the program.
  - Catch all exceptions on the outermost level, print them, then
    continue. This saves you the need to write a shell script as a
    wrapper.
  - Deselecting items originally selected with "a" has been fixed.

v2  2019-08-21
  [Fixed]
  - Selecting items and de-selecting them when "only show selected
    items" is active has been fixed.

  [Changed]
  - Actions (i.e., "set downtime" and "check now") now work on item
    under the cursor if nothing has been selected. (Previously, these
    actions worked on *all* items if nothing had been selected.)
  - "Set downtime" no longer has default values. Entering empty or
    invalid strings aborts.

  [Added]
  - Check output is shown in an extra pane.
  - Implement "check now".
  - "?" shows a help screen.
  - "Normal" keys like cursor keys work now.
  - "D" puts entire host in downtime.
  - "H" adds the host name of the currently selected item to the filter
    list, "S" does the same for the service name.
  - "e" runs an external program on selected items.
  - Show some mode indicators and a progress bar that shows the time
    until next auto-refresh.
  - Soft states are now indicated by "S".

v1  2019-08-12
  - This is the initial release of terminga.
