Release history for terminga

next
  [Fixed]
  - Selecting items and de-selecting them when "only show selected
    items" is active has been fixed.

  [Changed]
  - Actions (i.e., "set downtime" and "check now") now work on item
    under the cursor if nothing has been selected. (Previously, these
    actions worked on *all* items if nothing had been selected.)
  - "Set downtime" no longer has default values. Entering empty or
    invalid strings aborts.

  [Added]
  - Check output is shown in an extra pane.
  - Implement "check now".
  - "h" shows a help screen.
  - "Normal" keys like cursor keys work now.

v1  2019-08-12
