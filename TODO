-   Better text input.
    -   Backspace does not work? (Only in VTE terminals?)
    -   Umlauts don't work.
    -   Either implement a custom textpad or switch to urwid.
-   Show duration of current check status ("since when is it down?").
-   Display whether Icinga notifications have been disabled globally and
    add a hotkey to change this setting (if this can be done via API).
-   Maybe rewrite the handler to get passed all selected items in one
    go. Currently, it's not possible to work on more than ~10 items at
    once, because for each item an individual handler process will be
    started. That's not feasible.
-   setup.py
    -   Must not break a simple "clone and run" workflow, i.e. don't
        *force* users to use pip.
