A TUI for Icinga2.


Dependencies
------------

    - Python 3.7
    - python-requests


Installation
------------

Clone this repo and run `terminga`. Don't forget the configuration, of
course.


Configuration
-------------

Create ~/.terminga, which consists of a JSON dict:

    {
        "icinga_url": "https://icinga-terminga-proxy.smedia.tools",
        "api_auth": {
            "username": "myapiuser",
            "password": "myapiuserspassword"
        },
        "external_tool": "mytool -s __SELECTION__",
        "host_filter_params": {
            "host_filter_custom_varname": "is_customer",
            "host_filter_custom_varvalue": "false"
        }
    }

Use a valid API user, not your regular Icinga user.

"external_tool" contains a path to a user-supplied script and this
setting is optional. It will be invoked when you press "e" in terminga.
"__SELECTION__" will be replaced by the path to a file that contains
your selection: First line is host name, second line service name, third
line check output (with lines separated by \r rather than \n). This
repeats for each selected item, i.e. your script will only be called
once, no matter how many items you selected. It is the responsibility of
your script to remove this file after it has been read.

You will want to use terminga-proxy on your Icinga server, if you're
still running a version of Icinga2 that leaks memory on API requests:

https://bitbucket.apps.seibert-media.net/projects/SYS/repos/terminga-proxy

"host_filter_params" is optional, too. The value of this subdict will be
passed verbatim as a GET parameter to the Icinga API. It is meant to
restrict the list of hosts. If you do NOT use terminga-proxy, you can
use generic Icinga filters as explained in [0]:

    "host_filter_params": {
        "filter": "\"linux-servers\" in host.groups"
    }

[0]: https://icinga.com/docs/icinga2/latest/doc/12-icinga2-api/#advanced-filters

If you DO use terminga-proxy, those kinds of generic filters are NOT
supported. terminga-proxy only supports the following:

    "host_filter_params": {
        "host_filter_custom_varname": "is_customer",
        "host_filter_custom_varvalue": "false"
    }

With this config, all hosts must have a custom variable called
"is_customer" and the value must be "false". Hosts that do not match
this criterium, will not be visible in terminga.
